## 1. Defining Precision Medicine and its Significance

### What is Precision Medicine?
Precision medicine is an approach to medical treatment and healthcare that considers individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle in order to tailor healthcare and medical decisions to the unique characteristics of each patient [[1](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/precisionmedicine/definition/__;!!Mih3wA!Bkm3t9Q09-iJM6BJx8CmEeQAMA4OT5umKdK1wJD3TyKklEL82k-hRRVhUIoJBTD4bROnqq-g8iwOsIMELjY$ )].
With its focus on genetics, molecular biology, and personalized treatment approaches, precision medicine represents a significant advancement in the understanding and management of diseases.

### Background:

The backbone of precision medicine is rooted in the advancements of science and technology. Here are key elements contributing to the development of precision medicine:

1. Human Genome Project:

- After the discovery of the DNA double helix structure by James Watson, Francis Crick, with the help of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, the Human Genome Project, operated from 1990 and completed in 2003, identified and mapped all the genes in human DNA. This discovery is monumental as it provided a comprehensive reference for understanding the genetic basis of health and disease by enabling the identification of many genes that are associated with disease [[3]](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.britannica.com/event/Human-Genome-Project/Advances-based-on-the-HGP).
2. International HapMap Project:

- The completion of the human genome project enabled researchers all over the world to do the following (quoted from Human Genome Project:
> "identify and catalog genetic similarities and differences between individuals representing four major human populations derived from the continents of Africa, Europe, and Asia. The identification of genetic variations called polymorphisms that exist in DNA sequences among populations allows researchers to define haplotypes, markers that distinguish specific regions of DNA in the human genome" [[3]](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.britannica.com/event/Human-Genome-Project/Advances-based-on-the-HGP).
This advancement allowed researchers to further understand and identify whether certain genetic differences are linked to disease or protection from disease.

3. Technological Advances in DNA Sequencing:

- The development of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, particularly Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), is a major backbone of precision medicine as due to its speed in sequencing entire genomes at lower costs.This allowed researchers to efficiently identify genetic variations and study the genetic makeup of individuals on a larger scale.

4. Advancements in Bioinformatics and Data Analysis:

- The rise of computational biology and bioinformatics played a crucial role in managing and analyzing the vast amounts of data generated by genomic studies, allowing scientists to better interpret complex genetic information.


### What is the Significance?

Traditional medicine often followed a broader, less individualized one-size-fits-all approach, which didn't necessarily work due to differences in individual responses to treatment. Precision medicine is significant because it marks the shift from population based to individulized approaches.

> "This approach will allow doctors and researchers to predict more accurately which treatment and prevention strategies for a particular disease will work in which groups of people" [[1](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/precisionmedicine/definition/__;!!Mih3wA!Bkm3t9Q09-iJM6BJx8CmEeQAMA4OT5umKdK1wJD3TyKklEL82k-hRRVhUIoJBTD4bROnqq-g8iwOsIMELjY$ )].

This shift is supported by the understanding that variations at the individual level can significantly impact health outcomes.

### 2. Technological tools used in Precision Medicine

Precision medicine relies on a variety of technological tools to analyze and interpret individual patient data, especially genomic information to understand the molecular and genetic basis of diseases. Here are some key technological tools used in precision medicine:

_**Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)**_:

As mentioned earlier, NGL allows for the identification of genetic variations, mutations, and other genomic features that may be relevant to disease susceptibility and treatment at a lower cost and more efficent speed.

_**Bioinformatics and Computational Tools**_:

Computation tools are essential for managing, analyzing, and interpreting large-scale genomic data. These tools help identify genetic variants, predict their functional impact, and correlate genomic information with clinical outcomes.

_**Imaging Technologies**_:

Advanced imaging technologies, such as positron emission tomography (PET), which can detect atypical metabolic activity symbolic of a disease [[5](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pet-scan/about/pac-20385078__;!!Mih3wA!Bkm3t9Q09-iJM6BJx8CmEeQAMA4OT5umKdK1wJD3TyKklEL82k-hRRVhUIoJBTD4bROnqq-g8iwOssqXCyY$ )], and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which detects the internal structure of a patient's body, play a role in precision medicine by providing detailed insights into the structure and function of organs. This is significant to precision medicine as it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of a patient's condition which in turn, allows medical staff to better decide what treatment to give.

### 3. Precision Oncology - Brief Example of Precision Medicine

Precision oncology is a field within precision medicine that focuses on the application of personalized/targeted therapies for cancer treatment [[6](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19p-7f2P90dpXeBYPWCszkPU3T12OrDij/edit*slide=id.p1__;Iw!!Mih3wA!Bkm3t9Q09-iJM6BJx8CmEeQAMA4OT5umKdK1wJD3TyKklEL82k-hRRVhUIoJBTD4bROnqq-g8iwOV-DVymY$ )].  

Most recent development development in precision oncology is beyond targeting specific proteins of interest in tumor but recognizing that immune cells can be effective in cleaning tumor cells → T cells are meant to recognize tumor cells as unusual and start to kill them (process called cytotoxicity)

In precision oncology, therapies known as immune checkpoint inhibitors are designed to block the checkpoint receptors like CTLA4 and PD1 [[6](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19p-7f2P90dpXeBYPWCszkPU3T12OrDij/edit*slide=id.p1__;Iw!!Mih3wA!Bkm3t9Q09-iJM6BJx8CmEeQAMA4OT5umKdK1wJD3TyKklEL82k-hRRVhUIoJBTD4bROnqq-g8iwOV-DVymY$ )]. Understanding the steps required for T cell activation is crucial in precision oncology because it helps researchers and clinicians design therapies that can enhance T cell responses against cancer cells.

The receptors are crucial for preventing autoimmune responses and maintaining immune tolerance by inhibiting T cells, and tumor cells essentially take advantage of this to evade surveillance. By using the checkpoint inhibitors, it allows the right receptors like CD28 to bind to antigens and activate T cells to more effectively target and destroy cancer cells.

The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors exemplifies the precision medicine approach in oncology, because these therapies are often selected based on the specific molecular and genetic characteristics of a patient's tumor.

## 4. Pharmacogenomics - Example of Precision Medicine
### 4.1 What Is Pharmacogenomics?
According to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, pharmacogenomics aim to better understand how individual's genes affect their response to medications [[7]](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/pharmacogenomics.aspx#:~:text=Pharmacogenomics%20(sometimes%20called%20pharmacogenetics)%20is,or%20she%20responds%20to%20medications). While a majority of human DNA is identical, there are sequence variations that lead to different versions of the same gene. These are known as polymorphisms, and occur in individuals and populations. These differences, while seemingly small, can affect how drugs are uniquely absorbed, metabolized, and excreted in the body, and explains why responses to certain treatments vary. For this reason, Pharmacogenomics aims at understanding the root problem instead of finding a one-fits-all approach to treating symptoms. The image below shows the most common type of polymorphisms: Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP). An SNP is when the variant is a singluar base switch.
#### Example: Thymine Switched with Glutamine

### 4.2 The History of Pharmacogenomics

The beginning of pharmacogenomics dates back to 510 B.C. when Pythagoras observed that eating fava beans caused fatal results for select individuals [[8]](https://www.news-medical.net/health/Pharmacogenetics-past-present-and-future.aspx). However, lack of technology and understanding of genetics meant that no one during this time could provide a hypothetical hypothesis as to why. It took almost 2000 years before the human geneticist Friedrich Vogel discovered the enzyme polymorphism Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase gene which predisposed those with the mutation to hemolytic anemia in the presence of certain foods and chemicals [[9]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1363768/ ). Two of these chemicals (vivine and covicine) are in fava beans which finally answered why some people could not ingest them safely.

Using Gel Electrophoresis, more polymorphisms were discovered which impacted how medications and chemicals were distributed to patients. For example, polymorphisms in the liver enzyme CYP2D6 were found to contribute to atypical reactions to regulated drug doses [[8]](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/pharmacogenomics.aspx#:~:text=Pharmacogenomics%20(sometimes%20called%20pharmacogenetics)%20is,or%20she%20responds%20to%20medications). This was observed when administering the pain killer Codeine. This drug is usually gradually converted by the liver into its active form Morphine. However, some people have variations in their DNA which lead to having thousands of copies of the gene instead of just two. This means that for these individuals, Codeine can be metabolized too quickly and result in an overdose. The adverse affect can also occur in some cases where some people's gene code for a different protein stucture entirely, resulting in the drug never metabolizing correctly.

Another example of a breakthrough in pharmacogenomics was the link between Azathioprine toxicity and the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase. Azathioprine is a medication prescribed to treat rheumatoid arthritis and prevent transplant rejection after kidney transplants. However, negative side effects including Myelosuppression was linked to low TPMT enzyme activity which was reported to affect one in every 300 subjects [[10]](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1038/clpt.1989.10 ).

The Human Genome Project led to even more discoveries surrounding polymorphims. One of them linked variants of the gene CYP2C9 to adverse reactions to the anticoagulant Warfarin [[11]](https://rarediseases.org/gard-rare-disease/warfarin-sensitivity/), which will be discussed in further detail in Section 5.

### 4.3 Understanding the Cause Instead of Treating The Symptoms

Pharmacogenomics aims at understanding the root problem instead of finding a one-fits-all approach to treating symptoms. This means understanding how a drug interacts with the body. The three main concepts include cell receptor activation, cellular uptake, and drug breakdown [[18]](https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2016/04/29/explainer--how-do-drugs-work-.html#:~:text=Receptors%20are%20large%20protein%20molecules,or%20neurotransmitters%20%E2%80%93%20outside%20the%20cell.).
#### 4.3.1 Activating Receptors
Some drugs work by targetting the receptors on cells. When molecules bind to the receptors, a signal is generated, telling the cell to respond a certain way. Some drugs work by binding to a specific receptor in order to cause a process to increase. This is because the structure of the drug is designed to mimic the receptor's intended binding molecule, so the same response is generated. Some other drugs bind with a receptor in order to cause a process to decrease. If the drug can bind with a receptor, but is structurally different enough from the intended binding molecule, then the signal will not be indicated to the cell. Drugs that are designed this way depend on binding receptors. Differences in DNA mean that some individuals might have less or no receptors that can recognize the medication, leading to decreased effectiveness.

#### 4.3.2 Cellular Uptake
Another way drugs can take effect in the body is by targetting tissues and cells. In this method, drugs enter the cell via membrane transporters. Membrane transporters are proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane and only let specific molecules through. Similarly to receptors, this process relies on the quantity and structure of the targetted transporter. Thus, people can have varied cell permeability to the drug.

#### 4.3.3 Breakdown
Drugs are broken down by oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, hydration, conjugation, condensation, or isomerization with enzymes catalyzing these processes. This is necessessary in order for the drug to be easily excreted from the body. Depending on the expression of enzymes and other genetic factors, some people will more quickly metabolize medications than others. This can impact the dosage and effectiveness of a drug.

## 5. Warfarin Sensitivity
### 5.1 What is it and how does it work?
Warfarin is a popular anticoagulant given to prevent blood clots such as Venous Thrombrosis and Pulmanary Embolisms. In order for blood clots to occur, there needs to be a pressence of the correct form of vitamin K. This medication works by inhibitting the enzyme VKORC1 which converts vitamin K into the correct active form [[19]](https://www.nhsinform.scot/tests-and-treatments/medicines-and-medical-aids/types-of-medicine/warfarin ). However, polymorphisms in this gene (as well as those in CYP2C9 which metabolizes Warfarin) can lead to people varied responses. If a person metabolizes the drug too quickly, they can experience increased Warfarin sensitivity because they experience stronger effects at lower doses. This can then lead to overdoses and have fatal results. Precision medicine can be very useful in this case to cater towards the patient’s specific needs by fine-tuning the dosage of warfarin, or even finding alternative anticoagulants that are better suited in those who have warfarin sensitivity to prevent adverse effects of the drug.

### 5.2 Finding Variants
Obtaining a gene expression assay is key to precision medicine. Gene expression assays capture different gene expression patterns and variants in order to identify whether someone carries a disease or has a certain condition. Genome-Wide Association Studies can help scan markers and find genetic variations associated with a certain condition. One of the most commonly used gene expression assays is qPCR which can measure the presence of mutant genes. qPCR works by converting RNA into cDNA, then either measuring cDNA concentration or conducting a following qPCR reaction [[21]](https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/applications-technologies/what-real-time-pcr-qpcr?ID=LUSO4W8UU#:~:text=In%20research%20laboratories%2C%20qPCR%20assays,the%20presence%20of%20mutant%20genes). The expression result patterns help constitute distinct forms of a condition, and in this case, the patterns help to identify enzyme's responsivity to the treatment Warfarin. Using gene expression assays, it is approximated that 30-40% of Warfarin sensitivities are related to polymorphisms in either genes CYP2C9 or VKORC1.

### 5.3 Warfarin Genes of Interest
#### 5.3.1 CYP2C9
CYP2C9 usually codes for the enzyme found in the endoplasmic reticulum and mainly expressed in the liver and small intestine. In particular, the enzyme's job is to help break down steroid hormones and fatty acids [[23]](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/cyp2c9/). This enzyme is also responsible for metabolizing one of Warfarin's stereoisomers (S-warfarin), acting to reduce its concentration in the body. There are 2 SNPs in CYP29C (denoted by *2 and *3), which result in a longer break down. This means that the drug will be oxidized slower, stay in circulation longer, and result in a lower required dose [[24]](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1733331-overview?form=fpf#a1).

<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1lzxs_oEuuZokyD8fFIXIrpLXVrgExJT1" alt="drawing" width="600"/>

Image Source: [[25]](https://www.google.com/search?q=cyp2c9%2A2%2Band%2Bcyp2c9%2A3&sca_esv=590759824&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj6qvbQ6Y2DAxUcIUQIHcwxDYgQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=543&bih=815&dpr=2#imgrc=GrVnd-zpGK-IhM)

#### 5.3.2 VKORC1
VKORC1 is the gene responible for coding vitamin K epoxide reductase enzymes [[26]](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/vkorc1/). This enzyme helps form blood clots by converting one form of vitamin K into one that helps assist clotting proteins. An SNP where the G allele is replaced with the A allele leads to those with the variation to produce less of the enzyme [[24]](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1733331-overview?form=fpf#a1). Since Warfarin targets the VKORC1 enzyme, this variation can lead to a pharmacodynamic ‘on target’ adverse drug reaction. Therefore patients with this variant require much lower doses of warfarin due to increased drug sensitivity. Based on polymorphisms in these genes, a general guide for Warfarin dosing was generated. Along with genetics, race has been correlated to this indexing.
