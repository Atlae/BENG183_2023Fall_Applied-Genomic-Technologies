# Alternative Splicing

Anthony Vasquez, Omar Halawa, Yasmin Jaber

# Introduction

Alternative splicing is a powerful post-transcriptional mechanism that produces multiple mRNA isoforms from the same gene; the isoforms are then translated into functionally different, sometimes inactive, proteins. Alternative splicing is a major contributor to genetic diversity and gene regulation. As a result, there are numerous methods in the RNA-sequencing pipeline designed to analyze the expressions levels of the various mRNA isoforms.

### Historical Background and Discovery

Alternative Splicing was first defined in 1977 when researchers discovered that not only were introns spliced out of the mRNA of an adenovirus, but also a single mRNA could be spliced "at different junctions [resulting] in a variety of mature mRNA molecules, each containing different combinations of exons."

# Mechanics of Alternative Splicing

### Basic Mechanisms

Outside of constitutive splicing (normal splicing) there are five types of alternative splicing: [3] 
1. Exon skipping
2. Intron retention
3. Alternative 3' splice site
4. Alternative 5' splice site
5. Mutually exclusive exons

### Regulatory Proteins and Factors

There are two main elemental factors that facilitate alternative splicing: trans-acting elements facilitate the splicing of introns and exons, and cis-regulatory elements facilitate the binding of trans-acting factors to different introns and exons. 

Trans-acting factors include: SR proteins, which are rich in serine and arginine, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), various ribonucleoproteins, and proteins. Cis-regulatory elements include: exonic splice enhancer (ESE), exonic splice silencer (ESS), intronic splice enhancer (ISE), and intronic splice silencer (ISS). Exonic splice enhancers promote the binding of SR proteins contribute to the splicing of exons or introns, and exonic splice silencers promote the binding of hnRNPs which block the splicing of an exon.
