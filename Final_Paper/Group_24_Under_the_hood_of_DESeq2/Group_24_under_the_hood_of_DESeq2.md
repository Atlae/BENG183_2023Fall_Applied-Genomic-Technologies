## Introduction
The ability to obtain the entire transcriptome of a biological sample through high-throughput RNA-sequencing has created a need for tools that enable analysis of this data. One of the most powerful and widely used tools for this purpose is DESeq2 which applies a variety of statistical tools to identify genes that are differentially expressed between two or more experimental conditions, such as treatment versus control groups.
