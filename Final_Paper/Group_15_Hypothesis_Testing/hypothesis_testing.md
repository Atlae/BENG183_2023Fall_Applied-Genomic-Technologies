### What is Hypothesis Testing? Why is it important?

Hypothesis Testing is the use of statistical analysis on data to evaluate the validity of a hypothesis. It allows researchers to make evidence-based conclusions. 

The 5 steps of Hypothesis Testing:
    Form a Null and Alternative Hypothesis
    Gathering Data
    Generate a Test Statistic
    Generate P-value
    Interpret P-value and Make a Decision 

To illustrate the steps of hypothesis testing, we will be looking at a hypothetical case study. Our example case study will look at whether or not smoking causes lung cancer.
